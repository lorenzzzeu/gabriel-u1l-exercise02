                <!-- About me content -->
                <p>I am a graduate of University of the Philippines Los Baños Class of 2026 and my passion is Computer Science. I am from Taguig City, Metro Manila, Philippines.
                    My interests include web development, game development, mobile computing, and software design and development.</p>
                                
                    <p>Since I was in elementary school, I am a consistent academic achiever and always having the award of 'Best in Computer'. Since I was in my early years in high school, I found out about HTML and CSS and has been interested after that. I tried to study it in advance and, fortunately, we tackled about it during my Grade 10. I used my knowledge and did more studying to further advance my learnings. 
                    After that, I tried studying Python and kind of stopped there since I have not been able to have a free time. My passion for writing, I think, helped me in further advancing to these skills.</p>
