## Application Description:
In this exercise, we are tasked to create a single-paged static website using only HTML and CSS from scratch.

Live Website Link: 

## Things I did in the code:
At first, I created a template of my website portfolio for me to work on and used simple CSS styles. Then, I worked on deciding how my content should look and used the flexbox and some of its properties to design my website.

Then, I put on the content and modify the texts and information before putting images on the website. I put all of my images in one folder for it to be organized. After doing that, I modified some designs and finished the whole simple website.

## What are your key takeaways from this exercise?
The making of HTML and CSS only website is quite simple and fun. However, deciding what to design and what the website should look like is the hardest part for me. I am not good with designs and colors, so I struggled a bit. Overall, this is a simple exercise for refreshing our minds with HTML and CSS.
